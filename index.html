						<h2>Wallace - Adopted from a pet store</h2>
						<h3>Wallace is a little quirky and loves his costumes - sometimes.

							Wallace may have come from a pet store, but he advocates strongly for adoption.
							Please click his picture to see adoptable animals from his hometown of Fort Lauderdale, FL.

						<h2>Max - Adopted from Paws Across Pittsburgh</h2>
						<h3>Max appears to be part vampire bat - just look at those ears and fangs!  
							He may look a little scary sometimes, but is really just a big, cuddle-bug. 
							It may not be a bad idea to have some garlic and holy water nearby, though - just in case.
							Max would love for you to click his picture to see more adoptable animals from his shelter!

						<h2>Basil - Adopted from Arizona Animal Welfare League</h2>
						<h3>Basil was born in AZ and loves the sun.  He doesn't care if it's over 100 degrees, 
							and he's just as happy sleeping on rocks as he is sleeping on grass.  Just be 
							aware - he has no shame and may give you a NSFW pose!  
							Click the photo to check out available animals at Arizona Animal League.
